# Interactive NSWindow Swift Playground

This playground provides a basic template, with some examples, for presenting an NSWindow that can take user input.

**Note:** Some interaction seems flakey. For example while NSButtons may be clicked, NSTextFields revert focus back to the playground editor. Contributions to improve the usability are welcome.
